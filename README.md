This project is a Movie Booking System implemented using Python's Tkinter for GUI design. It allows users to book movie tickets by selecting available seats in designated theaters. The system manages movies, theaters, and bookings through organized classes such as Movie, Theater, MovieTree, and BookingQueue.

Key Features:

Movie and Theater Management: Users can add new movies and theaters to the system.
Seat Selection Interface: The GUI displays available seats, allowing users to select seats for booking.
Booking Queue System: Ensures bookings are processed sequentially.
Search Functionality: Uses a binary search tree (BST) for efficient movie lookup.
Error Handling: Ensures robust input validation and error messages for incorrect or incomplete entries.
To run the application, execute the script, and the Tkinter GUI will guide you through the booking process.
